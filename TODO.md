# TODO

1. Configure MongoDB and setup connection in .env file.
2. Run node index.js locally and verify connection.
3. Run frontend dev locally and verify that frontend can talk to backend. If not then do some research... either in course or online.
4. Once this is working then try to get online deployment working.
